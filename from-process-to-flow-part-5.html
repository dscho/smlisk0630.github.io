        <article>
            <p>
                You’ve done a great job so far building your Flow! We’ve created variables, the first screen element,
                the create records element, and the decision element. We’re now at the halfway point in the Flow with
                two more screen elements and an action element left to build. Let’s get started.
            </p>
            <h3>Element 4: Upload Attachments Screen</h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="images-flow" name="File Upload Element" alt="file upload element"
                    src="/assets/Images/Upload Attachments Screen.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                At this point you may be thinking, “Wait, I thought we already configured the fields for uploading
                attachments!” You’re right, we have. What we haven’t done yet is create the actual screen where the user
                will upload the files. Let’s do that now.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Pull a Screen Element from the Toolbox onto the canvas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the right, enter a Name and Description for this screen, e.g. “New Case” (“New_Case” for the API
                    Name).
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the “Configure Frame” menu, uncheck the “Show Header” box.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click the arrow to the left of “Control Navigation” to show the options available for moving through
                    the Flow. Uncheck “Previous” and “Pause,” but leave “Next or Finish” checked.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Screen Component</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Now we add a Screen Component. We only need one, but this one will require a little more
                    configuration than some of the others we’ve done. Drag the “File Upload” Component onto the canvas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As you’ve done with previous Components, give it an API Name for the Component and a File Upload
                    Label for users to see.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the “Allow Multiple Files” box, enter “True” and select “$GlobalConstant.True.” This allows users
                    to upload more than 1 file at a time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the “Related Record ID” box, enter and click the name of your Data Collection Variable, then
                    click “Case Id.” Once again, your variable should look like “{!varCaseData.Id}.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check the box labelled “Manually assign variables (advanced).”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scroll down to the “Content Document IDs” box. Here you’ll create a new variable to store the IDs of
                    the files uploaded by the user.
                </li>
                <figure>
                    <img class="images-flow" name="File Upload Screen Component" alt="file upload screen component"
                        src="/assets/Images/File Upload Screen Component.png" />
                </figure>
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>
                        Click in the box and select “New Resource.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give the variable a Name (following the variable naming conventions you set earlier) and
                        Description.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose the “Text” Data Type and check the box labelled “Allow multiple values (collection).”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check both boxes to make the variable available for input as well as output, then click “Done.”
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Scroll down to the “Uploaded File Names” box and create a new variable to store the names of the
                    files uploaded by the user. The names of the files will be displayed on the final screen at the end
                    of the Flow to show the user which files they have uploaded.
                </li>
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>
                        Click in the box and select “New Resource.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give the variable a Name (following the variable naming conventions you set earlier) and
                        Description.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose the “Text” Data Type and check the box labelled “Allow multiple values (collection).”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check both boxes to make the variable available for input as well as output, then click “Done.”
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Click “Done” to exit the Screen element, then connect the Decision element to it. You must make the
                    connection going from the Decision element to the Screen element and the outcome must be the one you
                    set up for when attachments are needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "Save."
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Element 5: Email Alert</h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="images-flow" name="Email Alert Element" alt="email alert element"
                    src="/assets/Images/Email Alert Element.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                Next, we need to set up the Email Alert that will be sent to the Admin to notify them of a new Case.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Drag the Action element onto the canvas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of filtering by Category, filter by Type and click “Email Alert.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the “Search email alerts” box, search for the API Name of the email alert you’ve created to be
                    sent to the Admin. Click on it once you find it, then click “Done” to exit the Action element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Connect the Upload Attachments Screen element to the Action element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Connect the Decision element to it, <strong>ensuring again that the connection goes from the
                        Decision toward the Action. The outcome should be the default outcome.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure there are 2 elements connecting to the Action element: Upload Attachments Screen and Decision
                    screen. If those elements are not connected to the Action element, do so now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click “Save.”
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Element 6: Summary Screen</h3>
            <p>
                We’re finally in the home stretch of building our Flow! Now the only element left is the final Screen
                element, which will function as a sort of summary to the users of the details of their Case. Ready?
                Let’s do it!
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Drag the Screen Element onto the canvas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the right, enter a Name and Description for this screen, e.g. “New Case” (“New_Case” for the API
                    Name).
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the “Configure Frame” menu, uncheck the “Show Header” box.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click the arrow to the left of “Control Navigation” to show the options available for moving through
                    the Flow. Uncheck “Previous” and “Pause,” but leave “Next or Finish” checked.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Screen Components</h4>
            <figure>
                <img class="images-flow" name="Summary Screen Element" alt="summary screen element"
                    src="/assets/Images/Summary Screen Element.png" />
            </figure>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Drag a “Display Text” component onto the canvas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give it an API Name.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Now you have a decision of your own to make. How many of the Case details do you want to show the user
                in your summary? One or two? More? All?
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    List the fields out in the larger box under the “Insert a resource” box. For readability, list them
                    each out on separate lines and bold them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now we want to insert the variable we created for each field. For the Type field, click in the
                    “Insert a resource box, enter “Type,” and choose the “Type” option under “Screen Components.”
                    “c:fsc_quickChoiceFSC” may appear under the word “Type.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scroll down in the menu that appears and click “Value.” Then copy/paste the result beside the
                    appropriate field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat Steps 2-3 for the Priority field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the Subject and Description fields, click in the box and enter “Subject” or “Description.” A
                    little menu will appear titled “Screen Components” with a “Subject” (or “Description”) option, which
                    you should click.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the Account and Opportunity lookup fields, click in the box and type “Account” or “Opportunity”
                    and select the “Accounts” (or “Opportunity”) option under Screen Components. It may say
                    “flowruntime:lookup” under the word “Accounts” (or “Opportunity”).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Choose “recordName”. Then copy/paste the result beside the appropriate field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, enter the name of your Files Collection Variable and copy/paste the result beside the
                    appropriate field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click “Done,” then connect the Action element to the final screen element. Click “Save.”
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Phew! Congratulations—you’ve just built your Flow. Note: Your Flow may or may not look exactly like mine
