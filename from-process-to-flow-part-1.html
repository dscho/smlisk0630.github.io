        <article>
                <p>
                    In 2019, I published a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-ad-hoc-automation-salesforce-case-management-solo-lisk-m-s-/" target="_blank">how-to article on LinkedIn</a> for Salesforce Administrators seeking a way to manage internal Salesforce-related tickets within Salesforce itself. This process was accomplished with OOTB Sales Cloud features, enabling Administrators to manage tickets without having to purchase Service Cloud.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    One year later, this case management system has been working well for me. Users submit a Case, I am notified automatically, and Chatter posts enable me to keep all communication regarding the Case right there on the Case record—no more chasing down emails from 2 weeks ago! In addition, Case reports and dashboards allow me to track and quantify all types of information about the Cases, from the Type (useful for determining user pain points and training needs) to the average amount of time my Cases stay in Open Status.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if this system is working so well, why should we change it?
                </p>
            <h3>
                Future-Proofing
            </h3>
                <p>
                    As a software user, you are already aware of periodic new releases and updates to your favorite apps and programs. The flip side of this coin is that software companies eventually stop supporting older, outdated versions of their products, a process known as “deprecation.” In some cases, the products may be retired, or shut down, completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same is true of Salesforce functionality. While the release of the Lightning UI and relative lack of updates to the previous Classic interface comprise one of the most high-profile examples within the Salesforce ecosystem, it isn’t the only one. If you’ve been paying attention, you’ve noticed that Salesforce is no longer enhancing—that is, releasing new functionality for—workflow rules. Workflow rules allowed users to take a large leap forward in automation when first released, but compared with the tools now available, they are painfully limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Process Builder was the next generation of automation functionality. It allowed additional actions to be performed, such as submitting records for approval, invoking other Process Builders, and posting to Chatter. It also allowed access to related records and could be triggered in multiple ways. As Process Builder grew in popularity and usage, the writing on the wall was clear to Salesforce: it was time to move on and focus on improved functionality. Eventually, the company stopped releasing updates to Workflow Rules and turned its attention to Process Builder. In fact, there is at least one <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/workflow_migration/workflow_migration_intro" target="_blank">Trailhead badge</a> dedicated to migrating Workflow Rules to Process Builder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This focus on the platform’s continuously-improving capabilities now brings us to Flow.
                </p>
            <h3>
            Improved Functionality
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Just as there are few things Workflow Rules can do that Process Builder can’t, so Flow’s functionality is an improvement over that of Process Builder. As mentioned in the <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/flow-basics/get-started-with-flows" target="_blank">Get Started with Flows module on Trailhead</a>, Flow is essentially “visual coding,” that is, coding with a declarative UI. While technically the same is true of Process Builder (yes, <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=process_troubleshoot_debuglogs.htm&type=5" target="_blank">Salesforce considers processes built in Process Builders to be Flows</a>), Flows are more versatile. Among other attributes (developer joke!), Flows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>are not limited to a single object</li>
                    <li>can iterate, or go through, a collection of records and then take action on those that meet the criteria</li>
                    <li>can delete single or multiple records as well as creating and updating them, functionality not limited to child records</li>
                    <li>involve decision logic that is more complex, allowing for a more accurate reflection of complicated business processes</li>
                    <li>can provide users with screens on which to view and input information, whether data or files, to achieve a result</li>
            </ul>
                <p>
                    But what if you have no coding experience? This is a large hurdle for many and must be considered. While it is true that to understand Flow you will have to learn certain programming concepts, such as variables, loops/iterations, and collections, it’s likely that you already know more than you realize. Did you know that formulas use code? That's right; when you use operators like <code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>!=</code>, or functions like <code>CASE</code>, <code>MAX</code>, and <code>FLOOR</code> in a formula, you're actually writing code! If you can learn how to write a formula, you can definitely learn how to create Flows.
                </p>
            <h3>
                Ahead of the Game
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Just as it has done for Process Builder, Salesforce is now constantly improving Flows, and given how greatly Flows allow Admins to extend native Salesforce functionality, it’s unlikely that they’ll be going away any time soon. While the company is still supporting Process Builder, the history of software development—including the Salesforce platform itself—shows that it’s only a matter of time until it too falls by the wayside. That’s why now is the best time for Admins to get ahead of the game and migrate Process Builder processes to Flows.
