            From Process to Flow: Part 4

            <p>
                In <a href="/https://smlisk0630.github.io/from-process-to-flow-part-3" target="_blank">Part 3</a>, we created and configured our first screen element—an intense task, but a worthwhile one. Now we have to tell the Flow to actually create a Case using all the information we gathered on that screen.
            </p>
            <h3>Element 2: Create New Case</h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="images-flow" name="Create Case Record Element" alt="create case record element" src="/assets/Images/Create Case Record Element.png" />
            </figure>
                <p>
                    Did you know that configuring the screen doesn’t actually create the Case record? That’s right; all we did in the last post was create the screen itself. Salesforce, like all programs, is not smart enough to know that the Case should now be created. We have to spell out every single step for it to understand what we want. First we told it that we want to have a screen and what we want to appear on that screen. Now we have to tell it to create a Case record and store the information in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: What about uploading attachments? Again, computers are not nearly as smart as we think they are. Salesforce has to create the Case record first before we can actually attach files to it; otherwise, there’s nowhere for the files to go! We’ll get to that element soon, don’t worry.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Drag the “Create Case” Element from the Elements menu in the Toolbox onto the Flow canvas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give it a Label and a Description.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose “One” for the number of records to create, and select “Use separate resources, and literal values” under “How to Set the Record Fields.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select "Case" as the Object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now we set the field values for the Case record. If the layout of this section looks strange to you, don’t worry—it’s not just you. Remember, Flows are code with a visual interface. When developers write code, they put the name of the variable (field) on the left and the value that should be assigned to it (stored in it) on the right. That’s right: fields on Salesforce records are actually variables, and when you save data in them, you are assigning that data to that variable as a value. That’s what you’ll be doing here: put the API Name of the field on the left and the value that should go in it on the right.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Start with the simplest fields, Subject and Description.
                    </li>
                    <ol class="lower-alpha">
                        <li>
                            In the Field box on the left, enter “Subject” and choose it from the little menu that appears.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the Value box on the right, click in the box and enter “Subject.” A little menu will appear titled “Screen Components” with a “Subject” option, which you should click. Does this sound familiar? You created this Screen Component in the New Case screen! Now you’re telling the Flow to go to that Component, pull out the value entered there by the user, and store that value in the Subject Field (variable).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeat Step 2 for the Description Field.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let’s assign a Value to the Type Field.
                        </li>
                        <ol class="lower-roman">
                            <li>
                                Enter “Type” as the Field.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Enter “Type” in the Value box. Click the option under “Screen Components” that says “Type” and underneath “c:fsc_quickChoiceFSC.”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Enter “Value” and click the “Value” option. Voila! You’ve just told Salesforce to store the value entered by the user on the screen into the Type field.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Repeat these steps for the Priority Field.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            Now we’ll assign a Value to the Account Field.
                        </li>
                        <ol class="lower-roman">
                            <li>
                                Remember the Field API Name? It’s the API name for the existing Account lookup field on the Case object. For me, it’s “AccountId.” Enter that in the Field box.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Enter “Account” in the Value box. Click the option under “Screen Components” that says “Account” and underneath “flow runtime:lookup.”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Choose “recordId.” Your Value should be “{!Account.recordId}.”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Repeat these steps for the Opportunity and User lookup fields
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            That just leaves the Record Type Id Field.
                        </li>
                        <ol class="lower-roman">
                            <li>
                                Enter “RecordTypeId” in the Field.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the Value box, enter or scroll down and click your formula variable, e.g. “formCaseRecTypeId.”
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            Now that all your fields (variables) have been assigned a value, click the “Manually assign variables (advanced” box at the bottom of the screen.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your last task for creating the Case record will be to store the Case record ID in your Case Data Variable. Enter and click the name of that variable, then click “Case Id.” Your variable should look like “{!varCaseData.Id}.”
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click “Done,” then connect the screen element to the create records element and click “Save.” Congrats! Now you’ve instructed the Flow to show the first screen to users and then to create the Case record by pulling and storing the data they entered on that screen.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
            <h3>Element 3: Attachments Decision</h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="images-flow" name="Attachments Requested Decision Element" alt="attachments requested decision element" src="/assets/Images/Attachments Requested Decision.png" />
            </figure>
                <p>
                    Good news: we’re almost halfway done building our Flow. The next step is to create a Decision element that will tell the Flow what to do based on whether the User needs to attach any files.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Drag the Decision element onto the canvas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give it a Label and a Description.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let’s tackle the simplest task first: changing the Label of the Default Outcome. The Default Outcome is the path the Flow will take if none of the conditions are met for other outcomes. In our case, the Default Outcome will be what the Flow does if the user does not need to attach any files to the Case. Click “Default Outcome” and change the Label to something that will reflect this outcome, such as “No Attachments Needed.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now we do same for the other Outcome. This Outcome represents the path the Flow will take if the user does need to attach files, so make the label something like “Attachment(s) Needed.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Condition Requirements should be “All Conditions Are Met (AND).”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We only need one Resource, and that’s the checkbox we created for the screen. Click in the “Resource” box and either scroll until you find it or enter the name if you remember it. Click it. The Operator will be “Equals.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Checkboxes represent Boolean logic, that is, Checked/Unchecked, True/False, or Yes/No. In this Outcome, remember, the user needs to attach files, so they will check the box. This means that our condition must be True, so type “True” in the Value field and click the “$GlobalConstant.True” option, which is equivalent to checking a box or indicating “yes.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click “Done,” connect the create records element to the decision element, then click “Save.”
                    </li>
                </ol>
